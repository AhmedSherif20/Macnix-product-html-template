8) Angular Binding
	// way to link between HTML and TypeScript 

	<-- one way data binding -->	
		1- {{}} =>> data interpolation
		<h1>welcome {{userName}} back </h1> // to put a value inside HTML tag

		2- [] =>> proerty binding
		<img [src]="imgSrc" /> // to put a value inside HTML attr 

		3- () =>> Event binding
		<button (click)="welcome"> say welcome</button> // short way to add eventlistener
		<input (keyup.shift.t)="test($event)" type="text" /> // other event and $event use to send click info

		<h2 [style.color]="boolen ==true? "red" : "green" ">Maro</h2>

	<-- two way data binding --> form HTML to TS 
		with banana box and anguler module =>> [(ngModel)]='x' that is mean take the value and put in variable x 
		NB: you must import angular form module inside ur module , add it in imports array of ur module

9) Angular Directives
